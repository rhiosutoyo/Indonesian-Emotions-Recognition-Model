# Indonesian Twitter Emotion Recognition using Feature Engineering
This GitHub was created to provide supporting research materials for other researchers.

- Dataset
This work utilized Indonesian Twitter Emotion Dataset from Saputri et al. Their dataset can be accessed at this link (https://github.com/meisaputri21/Indonesian-Twitter-Emotion-Dataset). More information can also be found in their paper (https://doi.org/10.1109/IALP.2018.8629262).

- Preprocessed Dataset
The preprocessed dataset was derived from the Indonesian Twitter Emotion Dataset. In the data preprocessing, this work performs case-folding, removes irrelevant information, applies standardization, data stemming, and removes stop words. The file can be downloaded in the CSV file (https://github.com/rhiosutoyo/emotion-recognition-model/blob/main/preprocessed-dataset.csv).

- Full Experiment Result
The full results of the experiment can be seen in the CSV file (https://github.com/rhiosutoyo/emotion-recognition-model/blob/main/full-experiment%20result.csv). The order is sorted by f1 score (descending).
