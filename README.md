# Indonesian Twitter Emotion Recognition using Feature Engineering
This GitHub was created to provide supporting materials for "Indonesian Twitter Emotion Recognition using Feature Engineering" to other researchers.

- Indonesian Twitter Emotion Dataset
This work utilized dataset from Saputri et al. Their dataset can be accessed in this link (https://github.com/meisaputri21/Indonesian-Twitter-Emotion-Dataset). More information can also found in their paper (https://doi.org/10.1109/IALP.2018.8629262).

- The Preprocessed Dataset
The preprocessed dataset was derived from Indonesian Twitter Emotion Dataset. In the data prepocessing, this work performs case-folding, remove irrelevant information, apply standarization, data stemming, and remove stop words.

- The Experiment Result
The full results of the experiment can be seen in the CSV file (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhiosutoyo/emotion-recognition-model/main/full-experiment%20result.csv).




"Twitter_Emotion_Dataset_PreProcess" contains 4.403 preprocessed Indonesian tweets derived from Saputri, et al (https://github.com/meisaputri21/Indonesian-Twitter-Emotion-Dataset).
